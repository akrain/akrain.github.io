In October 2019, I did a solo trek through the vibrant Markha valley. I took the classic route that goes from Stok to Hemis and crosses three high passes - Stok La, Ganda La and Kongmaru La. The trek can be done independently in the summers as most of the villages have basic homestays or campsites with food available on demand. I spent the first night in my own tent, the next 4 nights in hometays and the last one in a hired tent. All campsites along the route were closed at this time of year except for the one in Nimaling. However, most of the homestays were open.

## Preparations
I came to know about this route from Depi Chaudhary's informative book *Trekking in the Western Himalayas*. I also downloaded the GPS log from AllTrails and used the OSMAnd app to access it. I would have to figure out the part from Stok to Rumbak on my own as the GPS log didn't have it.

<span class="caption">Homestay in Stok</span>

Before starting, I spent a couple of days walking around Leh town for acclimatization and the second night was spent in a homestay in Stok village sipping copious amounts of *namkeen chai* (salted butter tea). After saying goodbye to my hosts in Stok, I hoisted my backpack and started off straight into the Stok gorge on a beautiful sunny morning. The trail is well marked with lavender and wild roses adorning its surrounding. It continues uneventfully along the Stok stream  till the campsite of Chang Ma (around 4100m) where it diverges into two. The main trail crosses immediately across a small stream and climbs steeply towards the Stok Kangri base camp. A smaller trail to Stok La continues along a smaller stream and crosses it about a 100 metres upstream. I confirmed the route with some porters and made my way along the almost dry stream.

After another 2 hours of steady uphill, I reached the campsite of Doksar, a high altitude grazing area used by locals to tend to their herds. The campsite was desolate with grass and small shrubs being the only sign of life around. A few stone shelters built by shepherds were empty as well and there was a small flat stretch just above them where I pitched my tent. The air was really thin at this altitude and mundane tasks like getting things in and out of the tent got the heart rate high. What made matters worse was the fact that the water source was about a 100 metres downhill from the campsite. It started getting cold by afternoon and after having an early dinner, I got into my sleeping bag by 6:00 PM. The high altitude made the whole night a struggle for sleep. I didn't get good sleep that night but was otherwise comfortable in my tent.

I got up early next morning and had tea and a couple of Granola bars before starting off for Stok La. The path goes straight up the mountain and joins the bigger trail coming from Stok Kangri base camp before heading south west through long, moderately steep switchbacks. Stok La is a double pass and the main pass is visible only after reaching the first one. Near the pass, the mountain suddenly changes from purplish brown and smooth on the east to light brown and spiny on the west. The oasis like village of Rumbak, cradled on all sides by smooth, barren mountains of various colors, can be seen in the valley to the south of the pass.

The path going down the pass is steep and mostly covered with scree till it meets a stream below. It gets easier once you cross the stream and take its true right to reach Rumbak. The village has a few houses most of which double up as homestays. I had a hearty meal in one of the homestays that included local bread, omelette and many cups of tea. I then followed it up with a nice afternoon nap which got me rejuvenated for the one hour hike to Yurutse.

Just outside of Rumbak, the trail from Stok La meets the dirt road coming from Jingchen. It then crosses the Rumbak stream as well as the bigger Jingchen *nallah* to move towards Yurtuse. There is a single, large homestay in Yurutse with basic rooms but the hospitality and food offered by the hosts is second to none. After a sleepless night at Doksar and a long day of walking, I was happy to settle down and grab some more *namkeen* tea.

<span class="caption">Stok Kangri</span>

From Yurutse the trail ascends gradually till you reach a tea tent at the base of the Ganda La. The ascent to the pass from there is not too hard if you are well acclimatised and the pass is reached in about 2 hours of steady walking. You get great views of the Zanskar range and the Stok Kangri group from the top with the Ladakh range visible in the distant north. The descent from the pass is fairly gradual and in about 2 hours you reach the beautiful hamlet of Shingo which in early October was shimmering in autumn colours.

<span class="caption">Shingo</span>

The path goes through a narrow gorge after Shingo and crosses the stream a few times to finally settle on its true right. On both sides, it is flanked  by steep, rocky cliffs of various colors which are home to a variety of high mountain wildlife. I was able to spot a big herd of Himalayan Tahr on one of the cliffs. In about 2 hours you reach Skiu which lies at the junction of the Shingo stream and the Markha river. Skiu is a large, green village with an old monastery and historic ruins that are worth exploring.

<span class="caption">Reaching Skiu</span>

The walk from Skiu to Markha is quite long with a few villages along the way. A large part of the trail is now replaced by a dirt road that runs along the river all the way to Markha. **I started off from Skiu when I noticed some movement behind some willow trees. I was taken aback when it turned out to be a herd of *bharal* (blue sheep) grazing right at the edge of the road. By the time I took out my phone for a photo, they had quickly moved up the steep, rocky slope.**

<span class="caption">Blue sheep</span>

The trail follows the true right of the river till it crosses the iconic, old wooden bridge over the Markha river to the other side where it continues till Sara. Sara is a small village with hardly five houses. I had instant noodles for lunch at a tea stall run by an elderly couple. They also treated me to a couple of glasses of *chhang*, the local liquor made from fermented barley, which refreshed me for the next part of the trail. 

A bridge after Sara takes you to a higher trail that continues till you reach a gateway with prayer flags. You get a breathtaking view of snow covered peaks over the wide Markha valley through this gateway while colorful trees and shrubs cover the valley floor.

The last part of the trail goes along the valley floor to cross the river a couple of times to reach Markha. There is a school on the outskirts the village where the trail divides into two - a really steep path goes towards the monastery and a flatter one goes along a school wall. I took the easier route which turned out to be much longer as it went around the village to enter it at the far end. I finally got to stretch my legs at the end of a tiring day in a small homestay that I found just before dark. A couple of bowls of soup followed by the Ladakhi delicacy *chu-taagi*, a vegetable broth with fresh homemade pasta, made me feel good before going to bed.

**The next morning was crisp and sunny after a thunderstorm at night.** Markha has some interesting ruins as well as a relatively new monastery that can be visited if time permits. About 2 km upstream of Markha village, there is a stream crossing but the water was low at this time of the year and a log across the stream allowed me to cross without getting wet.

The path then enters a shrub filled valley flanked by a sharp, pointed pinnacle on one side. The remarkable scenery looked like a frame from a Sergio Leone western. The pinnacle also marks the turn into a side valley that leads to Zanskar over the Rabrang La. The route known as Jumlam locally used to be a major trade road in the past but is hardly in use now.

After an hour's walk from Markha, I reached the Tacha monastery which sits precariously on a cliff top. The path to the monastery is steep but a visit to the top is well worth the effort. The old structure is made almost entirely of stones with nothing to bind them together. A lone monk affiliated to the Hemis monastery is posted in Tacha as caretaker. He was gracious enough to ask me inside his quarters where we had tea and talked about how it feels to be alone in such a place.

I had lunch in Umlung and reached Hangkar by late afternoon. The village is spread into a lower  and an upper 	part. Lower Hangkar is situated downstream on the Markha river where a side stream from the north meets it. The side valley has a magenta colored mountain range at its head below which lies a small village named Doltok. 

**Next morning, I left for Nimaling.**
The walk starts with a zigzag climb through a narrow ravine that leads to upper Hangkar. The village has the remains of an old fortress built on top of a steep crag. It is hard to imagine that a place with no electricty and roads used to be so important that it had a fortified town centuries ago.

From Hangkar, it is an easy walk along the river till you reach a bridge where the valley splits into two. The path across the bridge goes along the Langthang Chen river towards Zanskar. The path to Nimaling diverges before the bridge and goes along the left bank of the smaller stream named Nimaling Chu.

The views all around keep getting better as you climb up till you reach a couple of small lakes. One of the lakes has a statue of Padmasambhava installed in the middle with prayer flags along the periphery. The path then descends into the vast meadow of the Nimaling valley which extends for several kilometers along the stream. There are tents available for rent but the nights can get extremely cold here. It was good to have some company as two more groups had reached Nimaling the same evening - two Polish men and two Korean women who were with a local guide. Interestingly, I had met the two Polish guys before at a lesser known beach in Goa. So much for six degrees of separation!!

After a cold and windy night, the next morning was sunny and welcoming. After having a hearty breakfast, I left along with the other folks on a long, slow march towards Kongmaru La. The algorithm to reach the pass is simple - *walk a few steps, get tired, rest, look back at the sunlit mountains, and repeat*. As a consolation, there were the constantly changing views of Kang Yatse as clouds flirted around its twin peaks. The pass itself was cold and windy. After admiring the views and clicking a few photographs at the summit, I continued down the other side which was sunny and warm.

The descent was steeper with the mountains in all different colors - brown, black, emerald green, purple. After reaching a campsite, the trail enters a narrow gorge made of red sandstone through which a stream runs that continues for about an hour. As you come out of the valley, rock formations shaped like the Easter Island giants can be seen along the slopes. The valley finally starts widening as one reaches the village of Chogdo which is connected by road now. **I took a taxi to Leh and visited the excellent Hemis monastery which lies a short way off the road to Leh.**

## Conclusion

The fortress and other old structures in the valley indicate that it must have been quite prosperous in an earlier era.
