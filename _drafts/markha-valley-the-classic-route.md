Opening - surpsrise / wonder / dumbstruck

In October 2019, I did a solo trek through the Markha valley. I took the classic route that goes from Stok to Hemis and crosses three high passes - Stok La, Ganda La and Kongmaru La. The trek can be done independently in the summers as most of the villages have homestays or campsites with food available on demand. I spent the first night in my own tent, the next 4 nights in hometays and the last one in a hired tent. All campsites/dhabas along the route were closed at this time of year except for the one in Nimaling. However, most of the homestays were open.

## Preparations
*Add research done - route map, gps, depi's book*
I came to know about this route from Depi Chaudhary's excellent *Trekking in the Western Himalayas*. After getting a good idea about the route, I downloaded the GPS log from --- and used the OSMAnd app to access it. I would have to figure out the part from Stok to Rumbak on my own as the GPS log didn't have it.


Before starting, I spent a couple of days walking around Leh town for acclimatization. The second night was spent in a homestay in Stok village sipping copious amounts of *namkeen* (salted butter) tea.

The trail enters the Stok gorge and continues along the river till the campsite of Chang Ma (around 4100m). Here, the trail diverges into two. The main trail crosses immediately across a small stream and climbs steeply towards the Stok Kangri base camp. A smaller trail to Stok La continues along the small stream and crosses it about a 100 metres after the camp. I confirmed the route with some porters and made my way along the dry stream. I reached the campsite of Doksar (\~4500m) by 12:30 pm after walking for about 2 and a half hours.

The campsite was desolate with shrubs being the only sign of life. A few stone shelters built by shepherds were empty as well. I pitched my tent on a flat stretch of land just above them. It started getting cold by afternoon. I had early dinner and got into my sleeping bag by 6:00 PM. The high altitude made the whole nght a struggle and doing eve mundane things like squatting down required a big effort. I didn't get good sleep that night but was otherwise comfortable in my tent. 

In the morning, I had some tea and a couple of Granola bars before starting for Stok La. The path goes straight up the hill and joins the main trail coming from Stok Kangri base camp before heading south west through long, steep switchbacks. Stok La is a double pass and the main pass is visible only after reaching the first one. The pass itself is at a point where the mountain changes from reddish brown soil on the east to light brown, spine like rocks on the west. Smooth, barren mountains of various colors cradle the oasis like village of Rumbak on all sides.

The path going down the pass is steep and mostly covered with scree till it meets a stream below. It gets easier once you cross the stream and settle down on its true right till you reach Rumbak. I had a hearty meal with lots of tea, followed it up a nice nap in the afternoo sun and then left for Yurutse. There is a single, large homestay in Yurutse which has great hospitality. After a long day and sleepless night, I was happy to settle down and grab some more *namkeen* tea to lift my spirits. 

From Yurutse, the trail ascends gradually till you reach a tea tent at the base of the Ganda La. The pass is reached in about 2 hours. From the top, you get great all around views of the Zanskar range, Stok Kangri as well as the  Ladakh range in the distance. The descent from the pass is fairly gradual till you reach beautiful hamlet of Shingo, which at this time of year was resplendent in autumn colours. The path goes through a narrow gorge after Shingo and one needs to cross the stream a few times till it settles on the true right of it. It is flanked on both sides by steep, rocky cliffs of different colors and is a good place to spot some wildlife. I was able to spot a big herd of Himalayan Tahr on one of the cliffs. 

It takes about 2 hours to reach Skiu which lies at the junction of the Shingo stream and the Markha river. Skiu is a large village with an old monastery and a few historic caves that are worth exploring.

The walk from Skiu to Markha is long with a few villages along the way. The trail follows the true right of the river till you cross an old wooden bridge to the other side where it continues till Sara. I had instant noodles for lunch at a tea stall run by an elderly couple. They even gave me a couple of glasses of *chhang*, the local barley liquor, which refreshed me for the next part of the trail. There is a bridge after Sara which takes you to a higher trail on the true right again. This trail continues till you reach a gateway with prayer flags from where you get the first view of Kang Yatse over the wide Markha valley. Numerous trees and shrubs including sea buckthorn cover the valley floor. The next part of the trek goes along the valley floor and then crosses the river a couple of times over broken bridges to reach Markha village. There is a school outside the village where the trail divides into two - a really steep path goes towards the monastery and a flatter one goes along a school wall. I was quite tired and decided to take the easier route which turned out to be much longer as it went around to enter the village at the far end. I finally got to strech my legs at the end of a long day at a small homestay that I found just before it got dark. A couple of bowls of soup and the Ladakhi delicacy *chu-taagi*, a broth with fresh homemade pasta, for dinner were just what were needed before going to sleep. There was a thunderstorm that night and the surrounding mountains were sprinkled with snow in the morning.

The morning was crisp and sunny and I spent some time in the sun.

Before leaving, I visited the Markha monastery where three little kittens were playing in the sunlit courtyard. The monastery is nice and a newly built. Just outside Markha village, I crossed the river over a log bridge without getting wet. The path then entered a shrub filled valley flanked by sharp, pointed pinnacles towards the south. This remakarble valley looked like a frame from a Sergio Leone western. After an hour's walk from Markha, I reached the Tacha monastery which sits precariously on a hill top. The path to the monastery is steep but a visit is well worth the effort. The structure is made almost entirely of stones like a chorten and there is hardly anything binding the stones together. A lone monk affiliated to the Hemis monsatery is posted in Tacha as caretaker. He was gracious enough to ask me inside his room where we had tea and talked about how it feels to be alone in such a place. 

After this, Kang Yatse is visible almost throughout the way at the head of the valley. Hangkar village is divided into two parts - lower and upper Hangkar. Lower Hangkar is situaded where a side stream from the north meets the Markha river. I had some time in the evening and went on to get a better view of the side valley only to find the beautiful village of Doltok upstream.

In upper Hangkar, there are the remains of an old fortress built on top of a steep hill. The fortress and other old structures in the valley indicate that it must have been quite prosperous in an earlier era. You keep walking along the river till a bridge comes up. The path across the bridge leads to Zanskar. There is another path that goes along the left bank of the a smaller stream that comes from Nimalang. From here, the ascent is steep and views of Kang Yatse and the surrounding peaks keep getting better. Just before the Nimaling meadow, there are a couple of small lakes. One of them has a statue of Padmasambhava in the middle and the entire scene is quite sublime. The path then descends into the vast meadow of the Nimaling valley. The valley is broad and extends for several kilometers along the stream. There are tents available for rent and nights can be extremely cold. Two more groups had reached Nimaling the same evening - two Polish men and two Korean women with their local guide.

After a cold and windy night, the next morning was sunny and welcoming. After having a hearty breakfast, I left with the few other people on a long slow march towards the Kongmaru La. The trail to the pass is visible from the campsite and as you move up the trail, you see the sun rise over the Zanskar mountains behind you. You walk a few steps in the thin air, get tired, look back at the mountains behind, then move on. And then repeat. I got a few sublime pictures of Kang Yatse in the morning sun with a few clouds flirting around it. The pass itself was cold and windy at the top that I coudn't stop there for much time and continued down the other side where it was sunny and much warmer.

The descent is steeper with the mountains around are in all different colors - brown, black, emerald green, purple. After reaching a campsite, the trail enters a narrow valley and continues thorugh it for about an hour. As you come out of the valley, huge rocks shaped like the Easter Island giants are to be seen all around. Finally the valley starts widening and you reach the village of Chogdo which is connected by road now. I took a taxi to Leh and also visited the exellent Hemis monastery even though it was a bit off the way.
