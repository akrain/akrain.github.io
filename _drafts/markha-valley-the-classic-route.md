In October 2019, I did a solo trek through the Markha valley. I took the classic route that goes from Stok to Hemis and crosses three high passes - Stok La, Ganda La and Kongmaru La. The trek can be done independently in the summers as most of the villages have homestays or campsites with food available on demand. I spent the first night in my own tent, the next 4 nights in hometays and the last one in a hired tent. All campsites/dhabas along the route were closed at this time of year except for the one in Nimaling. However, most of the homestays remain open.

*Add research done - route map, gps, depi's book*


Before starting, I spent a couple of days walking around Leh town for acclimatization. The second night was spent in a homestay in Stok village sipping copious amounts of *namkeen* (salted butter) tea. 

I hoisted my backpack and started off into the wilderness. The trail enters the Stok gorge and continues along the river till the campsite of Chang Ma (around 4100m). Here, the trail diverges into two. The main trail crosses immediately across a small stream and climbs steeply towards the Stok Kangri base camp. A smaller trail to Stok La continues along the small stream and crosses it about a 100 metres after the camp. I confirmed the route with some porters and made my way along the dry stream. I reached the campsite of Doksar (\~4500m) by 12:30 pm after walking for about 2 and a half hours.

The campsite was desolate with just some shrubs and herbs being the only sign of life. A few stone shelters built by shepherds were empty as well and I pitched my tent on a flat stretch of land just above them. It started getting cold by afternoon. I had early dinner and got into my sleeping bag by 6:00 PM. The high altitude made the whole nght a struggle and doing eve mundane things like squatting down required a big effort. I didn't get good sleep that night but was otherwise comfortable in my tent. 

In the morning, I had some tea and a couple of Granola bars before starting for Stok La. The path goes straight up the hill and joins the main trail coming from Stok Kangri base camp before heading south west through long, steep switchbacks. Stok La is a double pass and the main pass is visible only after reaching the first one. The pass itself is at a point where the mountain changes from reddish brown soil on the east to light brown, spine like rocks on the west. Smooth, barren mountains of various colors cradle the oasis like village of Rumbak on all sides.

The path going down the pass is steep and mostly covered with scree till it meets a stream below. It gets easier once you cross the stream and settle down on its true right till you reach Rumbak. I had a hearty meal with lots of tea, followed it up a nice nap in the afternoo sun and then left for Yurutse. There is a single, large homestay in Yurutse which has great hospitality. After a long day and sleepless night, I was happy to settle down and grab some more *namkeen* tea to lift my spirits. 

From Yurutse, the trail ascends gradually till you reach a tea tent at the base of the Ganda La. The pass is reached in about 2 hours. From the top, you get great all around views of the Zanskar range, Stok Kangri as well as the  Ladakh range in the distance.The descent from the pass is fairly gradual and not very interesting till you reach beautiful hamlet of Shingo which looked resplendent in its autumn colours. The path goes through a narrow gorge after Shingo and one needs to cross the stream a few times till it settles on the true right of it. It is flanked on both sides by steep, rocky cliffs of myriad hues and is a good place to spot some wildlife. It takes about 2 hours to reach Skiu which lies at the junction of the Shingo stream and the Markha river. Skiu is a large village with an old monastery and a few historic caves that worth exploring.
