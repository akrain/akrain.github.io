On the Pilgrim's trail

19 June 2022 - 24 June 2022

The Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) in Kullu is one of the best-preserved natural treasures in India. A paradise for trekkers seeking solitude off the beaten path, it offers a wilderness experience rarely accessible elsewhere in the Western Himalayas. My first encounter with the Tirthan Valley was in 2013, during a trip to Spiti. Since then, I’ve returned to this valley multiple times, captivated by its raw beauty.

This trek goes to the holy spring of Hans Kund which is considered to be the source of the Tirthan River. The area surrounding the spring called Tirth is a significant pilgrimage site for the people of the Seraj region. The trek  begins near the village of Gushaini and follows a narrow valley carved by the river. This region is a biodiversity hotspot, with dense forests of oak and conifer, vibrant herbs, and a kaleidoscope of flowering plants. Together, they create an environment that allows for close encounters with exotic birds and high altitude wildlife.

Hiring a guide is essential to enter the park as many trails remain undefined. I was accompanied by a local guide and two porters. From Gushaini, a dirt road leads to the trailhead near Ropa (1700m). The initial path is wide and relatively easy, tracing the Tirthan River on higher ground. Along the way, we were greeted by a thunderstorm and a heavy downpour, though it quickly passed. On-and-off showers accompanied us as we trekked towards Rolla, crossing Hippo Falls and stopping at the park’s entrance gate to have our permits checked.

From Rolla, the trail narrowed and hugged the riverbank, partly overgrown with bushes. In some sections where the riverbanks dropped off steeply, wooden bridges had been built to provide safe passage. Elsewhere, the trail ascended sharply away from the river, only to descend again closer to the water. During this stretch, we spotted several *ghorals* at close quarters, adding to the excitement. We arrived at the Chalocha campsite (2,300m) around 4:30 PM, a serene spot next to a small stream, featuring a forest hut and enough space for a few tents.

Distance covered: 13.5 km
To Nada Thatch:

The trail from Chalocha began with a steep ascent immediately after the campsite, weaving through dense deodar trees. The climb was tough but rewarding, with sightings of *ghorals* and the colorful Himalayan monal along the way. After the halfway point, panoramic views of snow-capped peaks unfolded, signaling our approach to Nada Thatch. The trail continued to climb until reaching 3,250m, after which it leveled out along an exposed ridge, offering dramatic views, before descending to the campsite of Nada Thatch (3,180m). The campsite is nestled under towering cliffs, where blue sheep and tahr can often be spotted. Birdlife was abundant, and the area was dotted with brown oak and stunted rhododendron.

The next morning, a steep descent from Nada Thatch was made even more treacherous by rain, making the already slippery trail quite difficult to navigate. The descent eased at Upla Balu (~2,500m), after which the path became more pleasant, leading us to Shankha, a site with a large cave, and a good camping area. Wild strawberries grew in abundance here. After lunch, we started walking but another downpour forced us to take shelter in a small cave until the rain eased.

We reached Majhoni campsite but decided to push on to Tirth as there was still daylight. The next section of the trek involved scrambling over boulders and navigating areas prone to rockfall. Part of the original trail had been washed away a few years earlier, forcing us to climb roughly 100m up a steep, bushy slope to rejoin a higher path. From there, we walked above the treeline through lush meadows filled with wildflowers — though by then, I was too tired to fully appreciate them. We finally reached Tirth (3,750m) around 7:30 PM and spent the night near the Bheem Dwari cave.



Jatholi to Asurbag

The meadow of Asurbag was visible in the distance, and at first glance, it seemed like a relatively easy walk. We set off around 8:45 AM, descending and ascending across multiple huge snow bridges across streams. Since the snow bridges hadn’t been crossed by many, we had to cut steps into the ice to safely navigate them. After several crossings, the trail steepened, leading us uphill to a breathtakingly beautiful meadow, blanketed in anemones, primroses, wild geraniums, and a wide variety of other wildflowers. From this vantage point, the vast meadows of Rakhundi, Nada Dhel, Marahani, and many others within the Great Himalayan National Park were clearly visible. I spent the rest of the day observing the flowers, admiring the glorious mountain vistas, and taking pictures all around the meadow.

It was the final day of our trek, and we needed to cross the pass to enter the Falachan Valley. The climb was slow and laborious, with a lot of huffing and puffing as we ascended. We reached the pass in about an hour. On the other side, the landscape changed dramatically, becoming rocky and barren. After descending 100 meters, we continued walking along a ridge that offered stunning 360-degree views of the surrounding peaks.

We crossed another, easier pass, after which the descent became steep and treacherous. The trail turned sharply downward, and navigating the loose rock required extra caution. After what seemed like an eternity, we reached the treeline and descended into a dense oak forest, where the path was covered in a thick layer of fallen leaves. The trail eventually opened up into a peaceful meadow, with a stream flowing through it. We followed the stream until we reached the road by 2 PM. By then, my legs and feet were aching from the steep descent and the long distance we had covered that day.
