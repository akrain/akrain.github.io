title: Winter trip to Prashar
---

Prashar is a small lake situated in the Himalayan foothills, about 49 km north of Mandi town in Himachal Pradesh. The lake lies in between the Dhauladhar and the Pir Panjal ranges and offers breathtaking views of both. Prashar is accessible by road through most of the year except in the winter (Dec-Feb). There is also a 7 km trail that starts from a village named Baagi that is accessible almost throughout the year.

#####Reaching there
With uncertainity in my mind  about the trail in mid-December, my idea was to hitchhike up the road from Baagi. Reaching Baagi proved to be much easier than expected. I took a bus from Delhi to Mandi on Friday night, and reached at 5:30 am next morning only to be welcomed (read jolted) by the severe chill in the air. I quickly added layers of warm clothing and asked about the buses to Baagi and Prashar. The only bus to Prashar leaves Mandi at 7:45 am but there was an earlier bus that could drop me about 4 kms from my Baagi. I took this bus and got off at a fork in the road somewhere in between the vilages Kataula and Baagi

Since the distance was a bit too much for a solo hike, I decided to hitch a ride from a guy on a scooter. The rider was a smart and confident young man who had quit a well paying job in Ahmedabad because he wanted to serve his state and its people. To my surprise, he was following the road to Prashar just to enjoy the ride and to watch the sunrise from a nice vantage point.

After walking for an hour, I was surprised to see a bus come up behind me. Glad to have some company, I joined them and they dropped us about 7 kms from the lake. From that point, I had the caretaker of the Forest Rest House for company and we took a short cut through the woods to avoid the last few switchbacks of the road. After that, the road is pretty much straight along the ridge with fabulous views of the Dhauladhars and Pir Panjal ranges.

#####The environs
Using all possible modes of transportation, I was surprised to find myself at the Forest Rest House by noon. The lake is about half a kilometer from the rest house. I dropped my stuff and had some hot tea ( I hadn’t had any breakfast ) before making a move towards the lake.

The lake itself is situated in a bowl shaped depression which results in it getting lesser snow than its surroundings. In mid-December, only one side of it had snow whereas the other half was dry. With a clear blue sky and hardly any breeze, the lake was serene and reflections of the afternoon sun sparkled on its surface.

The temple of sage Prashar adjoining the lake is believed to be from the 13th century and is almost completely made up of wood. It is an interesting three tier pagoda like structure having a conical top tier mounted on two pyramidal ones. On the inside, the woodwork is carved in medieval Indian tradition with figures of numerous deities as well as intricate geometric patterns. The doorway to the temple is framed in distinct patterns, of which the one depicting a couple of knotted snakes is almost lifelike. Inside the temple is a statue of Sage Prashar.

####Getting back (or, my misadventures)
By evening, a group of five youngsters arrived at the rest house and I came to know that the trail from Baagi was in good condition. I decided to take the trail on the way back and started off at about 9:30 in the morning. The trail can be divided into two parts —the upper half that goes through a grassland and  the lower half through a thick pine forest. The upper part was covered almost entirely under a few inches of snow and going down was great fun as the snow provided for good cushioning. The caretaker just need to follow the electricity lines till the start of the forested part. At that where the lines run into the forest, follow the path that starts a few meters towards their right.

Just before the start of the forested part, a beautiful pool of water came into the view just off the trail. The water in the pool had frozen into a thick sheet of ice and seemed to be a good place to try my ice skating skills (which really amounted to zero). After making sure that the ice was solid and a few tries of slow skating, I ran onto the ice sheet in an attempt to skate over it. But alas!! The next moment only made me remember what I had learnt in high school physics —that the coefficient of friction between rubber and ice is very low. The result was an embarrassing crash into the ice sheet that literally broke the glass. That I survived the crash without any broken bones was the only comforting factor.

The latter half of the trek was completed in due silence and with an effort to minimize all risk. Half a kilometer from Baagi, a mini landslide had washed away the main trail and I had to figure out a detour. From Baagi, another good fellow dropped me to Kataula from where I took a bus to Mandi.

####Conclusion and Info
Overall, the trip was quite rewarding and besides the crash on the ice, everything else played out really well. The majestic, almost 270° views of the Himalayas that the place affords combined with the ease of reaching Prashar really makes it a great weekend escape. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I leave you with a couple of more panaromic views of the mountains.
