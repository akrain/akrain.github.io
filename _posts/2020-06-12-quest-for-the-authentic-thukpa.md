Title: Quest for the Authentic Thukpa
---

It was a fine sunny September morning as I reached Leh, more than 9 years after my last visit. As most of the establishments in Leh had closed before the onset of winter, I decided to look for accomodation close to the main market. After about an hour of walking around, I found a decent budget hotel (Mehak) to stay at the start of Changspa Road. By the time I checked in, I was feeling hungry and really wanted to have some local food for lunch.

An intense craving for authentic thukpa had gotten hold of me and drove me to look for a local eatery. I hadn’t had a great thukpa in a long, long time ago. The bland noodle soup with cabbage that I had had last time in a touristy part of Leh had been terrible. Now, not only did I want to have thukpa but I also wanted to have an authentic one that was spicy and had some meat in it.

As I went through the main market, I saw that it had changed quite a lot. The old shops had given way to new multi-cuisine and Kashmiri restaurants, fancy coffee shops and delhi style momo stalls. In this modern market aimed at tourists, there wasn’t a local eatery to be found. I kept walking downhill and went into Moti Market looking for some other stuff. As I was approaching the last few shops, I saw a board with pictures of momos and thukpa on the first floor of a building. It was a small eatery named Ldumra and as I went up the stairs, I saw a door that said “Master-chef” and I knew that I would like to have food here.

I ordered mutton thukpa with mutton momos (or mok-mok as they are locally called) and waited for the food to come. When it finally arrived, just the sight of it in the bowl was enough to get rid of my blues. I hungrily gorged on the momos and then went on to finish the noodle soup. In the end, it was the most awesome thukpa I had ever had, and it erased the memory of all the bad ones that I had eaten in the previous years.

The next morning, I decided to walk up to Shanti Stupa which provides a panoramic view of Leh and the nearby villages. As the morning progressed, the first rays of the sun hit the Stok range and then the sunlight gradually inched its way towards the town of Leh.

For breakfast, I again decided to have something local and went to a small joint run by industrious women named De Khambir. The khambir is a local bread made with fermented wheat flour and is traditionally served with the local salted butter tea. I had cheese filled khambir and apricot juice and it was good to keep me going for the next few hours.

While loitering around the previous day, I had noticed a nice, posh restaurant named Namza which had a variety of ethinic dishes. I decided to give it a try and had my lunch there. It turned out to be awesome. They have an eclectic menu that not only features Ladakhi cuisine but also Balti and central Asian dishes. During my few days in Leh, I had three meals at this place and not only is the food awesome but also the place has great hospitality and cosy seating. The lady who runs the place also has a designer boutique just next to the restaurant.

This time, I also took some time out to visit the recently renovated Leh Palace. The palace was not in great shape earlier but over the past few years the Archeological Survey of India has done a great job to get it in much better shape. The exterior walls and woodwork have been completely overhauled and some of the rooms have been restored as well. The royal shrine in the palace is worth a visit for a few moments of silence and the terraces on the upper floors provide a great view of the old town.

All in all, my short stay in Leh was mostly spent roaming around and trying the local food. I found some really great places to eat, and to top it all, I finally found the perfect thukpa.
