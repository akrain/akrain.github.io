It was a fine sunny September morning as I reached Leh, more than 9 years after my last visit. As most of the establishments in Leh had closed before the onset of winter, I decided to look for accomodation close to the main market. After about an hour of walking around, I found a decent budget hotel (Mehak) to stay at the start of Changspa Road. By the time I checked in, I was feeling hungry and really wanted to have some local food for lunch.

An intense craving for authentic *thukpa* had gotten hold of me and drove me to look for a local eatery. I hadn’t had a great *thukpa* in a long, long time ago. The bland noodle soup with cabbage that I had had last time in a touristy part of Leh had been terrible. Now, not only did I want to have *thukpa* but I also wanted to have an authentic one that was spicy and had some meat in it.

Walking through the main market, I saw that it had changed quite a lot. The old shops had given way to new multi-cuisine and Kashmiri restaurants, fancy coffee shops and Delhi style momo stalls. In this modern market aimed at tourists, there wasn’t a local eatery to be found. I kept walking downhill and went into Moti Market looking for some other stuff. As I was approaching the last few shops, I saw a board with pictures of momos and *thukpa* on the first floor of a building. It was a small eatery named Ldumra and as I went up the stairs, I saw a door that said “Master-chef” and I knew that I would like to have food here.

I ordered mutton *thukpa* with mutton momos (or mok-mok as they are locally called) and waited for the food to come. When it finally arrived, just the sight of it in the bowl was enough to get rid of my blues. I hungrily gorged on the momos and then went on to finish the noodle soup. In the end, it was the most awesome *thukpa* I had ever had, and it erased the memory of all the bad ones from the previous years. Later, I came to know that Ldumra is the Tibetian name for Nubra and literally means “valley of flowers”.

The next morning I decided to walk up to Shanti Stupa for a panoramic view of Leh and the surrounding mountains. The streets were all deserted as I made my way along Changspa Road to the base of the hill. From there you can either take the stairs or continue on the road. Halfway up stairs, the first rays of the sun hit the Stok Range and then the light gradually made its way towards the town of Leh. I meditated at the shrine in the calm morning before completing a *parikrama* of the main Stupa. After taking in the morning views for one last time, I made my way back to the town.

## Culinary delights

By the time I was back it was time for breakfast, found a small joint named De Khambir which was run by some industrious women. The *khambir* is a local bread made with fermented wheat flour and is traditionally served with the local salted butter tea. I had cheese filled *khambir* and apricot juice and it was good to keep me going for the next few hours.

While searching for a hotel the other day, I had noticed a nice, stylish restaurant named Namza that had a variety of ethinic dishes. They have an eclectic menu that not only features Ladakhi cuisine but also Balti and central Asian dishes. The Yarkhandi pulao, a dish that travelled to Leh over the ancient Silk route, and the buckwheat pancakes with apricot sauce are especially recommended. To go with the awesome food, the place has great hospitality and I ended up having most of my meals there.

## Winding up

On this trip, I also took some time out to visit the recently renovated Leh Palace. The palace was not in great shape earlier but over the past few years the Archeological Survey of India has done a decent job to get it in much better shape. The exterior walls and woodwork have been completely overhauled and some of the rooms have been tunrned into photo galleries. The royal shrine in the palace is worth a visit for a few moments of silence and the terraces on the upper floors provide a bird's eye view of the old town.

All in all, my short stay in Leh was mostly spent roaming around and trying the local food. I found some really interesting places to eat, and to top it all, I finally found the perfect *thukpa*.
